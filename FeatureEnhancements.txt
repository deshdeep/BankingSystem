
1. In "virtual bool checkForNumericInCharacterField(const string&)" in  "class InterfaceInputValidations" is not validating string 
   char by char. In future it should. Similarily for other virtual functions too.

2. Implement "checkForValidDate" in class Account in future.

3. Use random function for User class member variables initialisation in Account class in openAccount function 

4. Add documentation for each functions and variable types in header and interface files.

5. Currently at some places while taking input, if input is not valid I am just stopping the workflow. Implement a strategy where 
   it waits till user enter proper input or something to like this to handle the scenario.

6. Currently there is just one static object to play with...next list of dynamically created objects...next create db connection and store data in db
